    <!-- TEAMS & CAPTAINS -->
    <h2><span class="emoji">🧠</span>Teams & Captains</h2>
    <div class="rule-block">
      <p>
2.1    Each Captain must appoint a Vice-Captain to manage the team in their absence.
2.2    Captains are responsible for managing their roster and informing admins promptly if a stand-in is needed (see Section 3 for Stand-in Rules).
2.3    Players must maintain at least 75% attendance to be eligible for prizes.
2.4    Captains should try to resolve minor issues internally. If unresolved, escalate it to an admin.
2.5    If any issues are anticipated before a match, players or captains must inform the admins in advance. Early communication helps prevent disruptions to the tournament.
2.6    Concerns should be raised by typing !ticket followed by their TeamName and concern in the text channels. Example: !ticket TeamKolly game is lagging
2.7    All match lobbies will be created by TRR admins. In rare cases where a captain needs to create the lobby, it must include the official TRR tournament ticket.

    <!-- STAND-INS -->
    <h2><span class="emoji">🧍‍♂️</span>Stand-ins</h2>
    <div class="rule-block">
      <p>
3.1    Only 1 stand-in allowed. More than 1 needs Admin approval and they have right to deny it.
3.2    All stand-ins will be provided by TRR admins.
3.3    Teams must notify the admins at least 2 days in advance if a stand-in is required.
3.4    Last-minute stand-in requests are not guaranteed to match the original player's MMR range.
3.5    Teams may suggest a stand-in from the official stand-in list and eliminated players, but final approval lies with the admins.
3.6    Stand-ins must be within a 300 MMR range (higher or lower) of the replaced player’s registered auction MMR.
3.7    If a higher MMR stand-in (beyond the 300 range) is suggested, opposing captain approval is required, in the presence of both captains and an admin.
3.8    Unauthorized stand-ins will result in an automatic forfeit of the match.
3.9    Only the MMR submitted during registration will be considered for stand-in eligibility — not the player's current or updated MMR.
      </p>

      <p><b>🧾 Additional Guidelines</b></p>
